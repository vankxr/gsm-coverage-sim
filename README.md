# gsm-coverage-sim
![](https://github.com/vankxr/gsm-coverage-sim/blob/master/demo.png)
Simple GSM coverage simulator in MATLAB. Simulates propagation using three different propagation models, calculates GSM relevant KPIs and exports data to a KML file.

It was my final project for the Mobile Communications subject of my ECE BSc.

`demo.kmz` includes a zipped KML example output that can be viewed in Google Earth
